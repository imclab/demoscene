.code, music, add gfx: sole

.ascii: diamondie

So here's finally the source code, almost six years after this was released.
It was doing nothing sitting idle in my hard drive, and publishing it will
be the only way I don't lose it :-)

The code is provided for educational purposes only. I take no blame for whatever
happens to your computer if you dare to run the demo. I take no blame also if you
take the code as a manual of good practices (it's not). But it shouldn't happen
anything bad, actually :-)

Have a look at the code, if you learn something interesting - even if it's what
shouldn't be done, it will have fulfilled its purpose.

I have tried to avoid modifying the code as much as possible, so that it keeps its
naivety and truly represents what a first demo looks like. This way,
new coders will never feel embarrased again. But at some points I had to call for
the cleaning brigade to show up and clean up the code, mostly because some parts
were buggy as hell and didn't even show anything on the screen. Other times, it was
because there could easily be 300 lines of code which did nothing and were very
confusing if I expect anyone to learn something from the sources.
Unused code and images have been deleted as well. The song has been optimized a bit
so it now uses approximately 400k less.

There's a general lack of comments and when there are comments, they might easily be
in Spanish. When you're coding in a hurry or when you're coding late at night in a
hurry you just write down whatever comes to your mind in whichever form it comes, so
that's why some comments are in Spanish. I have kept most of them, they look funny 
to me. Maybe they won't to you, even if you can read Spanish. My sense of fun might
differ from yours. Oh and there also some variable names in Spanish, and names with
mixed spanish/english parts. It's all part of the fun!

Many thanks to Spock/RGBA for helping with the dynamic library loading & linking
stuff, and to trace/xplsv for the support as usual :)


~~~~ REQUIREMENTS ~~~~

- A working gcc compiler
- 'make' 
- SDL development libraries installed on your system 
- a moderately decent graphics card which supports opengl
- a compiled version of SOIL in src/SOIL (for loading textures & saving screenshots)
- a copy of BASS dll/so/dylib in the root folder (for playing music)

You can get SDL, SOIL and BASS from here respectively:
http://www.libsdl.org/
http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html
http://un4seen.com/



~~~~ COMPILING ~~~~

For compiling, chdir to the 'src' directory and follow instructions for each system.

The output is placed in the root directory.

* Mac

make mac

* Linux

make linux

* Windows

If you want to contribute a Windows port, feel free to send me a patch or something.
The code is pretty much portable so nothing more than writing a Makefile target should
be required.



~~~~ RUNNING IT ~~~~

If you happen to be using Ubuntu, I have provided a python launcher for configuring 
the demo parameters without using the command line. From what I have tested, it should
work on any plain vanilla ubuntu.

Run it with 'python launcher.py' or if it's marked as executable, just double click it
and say 'Run' when asked if you want to Run or Display.

By default it will run in 640x480 fullscreen. This is the optimum resolution, because the
images are prepared for that size. Anything more than that just looks plain HORRIBLE, but
I have added support for more resolutions for the sake of compatibility.

Note: you need to compile the demo, prior to running the launcher. It will fail
otherwise.

~~~~ COPYING & MODIFYING ~~~~


The sources for the demo are GPL'ed. The GPL v3 license does not apply to SOIL (which is
under the public domain) neither to BASS (which is copyrighted shareware).
SDL is licensed under the GPL v2.

In short: if you make a remix of this demo, share the sources too! ;)
