~~~~ REQUIREMENTS ~~~~

- A working gcc compiler 
- 'make' 
- SDL development libraries installed on your system 
- a moderately decent graphics card which supports opengl 
- a compiled version of SOIL in src/SOIL (for loading textures & saving
screenshots) 
- for linux, libbass.so in the root folder (for playing music) 
- for mac, libbass.dylib in the src/bass/ folder is all what we need to
build the bundle

You can get SDL, SOIL and BASS from here respectively:
http://www.libsdl.org/
http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html
http://un4seen.com/

~~~~ COMPILING ~~~~

For compiling, chdir to the 'src' directory and follow instructions for each
system.

The output is placed in the root directory.

* Mac

make mac

This will generate a demo.app bundle application.

* Linux

make linux

It will generate an executable called 'demo'

* Windows

If you want to contribute a Windows port, feel free to send me a patch or
something. The code is pretty much portable so nothing more than writing a
Makefile target should be required.

~~~~ RUNNING IT ~~~~

If you happen to be using Ubuntu, I have provided a python launcher for
configuring the demo parameters without using the command line. From what I
have tested, it should work on any plain vanilla ubuntu.

Run it with 'python launcher.py' or if it's marked as executable, just double
click it and say 'Run' when asked if you want to Run or Display.

By default it will run in 640x480 fullscreen. This is the optimum resolution,
because the images are prepared for that size. Anything more than that just
looks plain HORRIBLE, but I have added support for more resolutions for the
sake of compatibility.

Note: you need to compile the demo, prior to running the launcher. It will
fail otherwise.

~~~~ COPYING & MODIFYING ~~~~

The sources for the demo are GPL'ed. The GPL v3 license does not apply to SOIL
(which is under the public domain) neither to BASS (which is copyrighted
shareware). SDL is licensed under the GPL v2.

In short: if you make a remix of this demo, share the sources too! ;)
