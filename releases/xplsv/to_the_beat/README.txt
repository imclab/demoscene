/ to_the_beat sources / xplsv
/ a fast 64k for euskal 16

This is the source code for xplsv's to_the_beat, a 64k intro 
released at euskal 16.

It is a superhypersimple intro. Graphics wise it's very poor;
the only interesting part is the sound system which is only a 
proof of concept. But if you want to have a look it's all there.
If you learn something from this, it's worth the look :-)


REQUIREMENTS

- A working gcc compiler
- 'make' and SDL development libraries installed on your system
- a moderately decent graphics card which supports opengl


COMPILING

For compiling, chdir to the 'src' directory and follow instructions for each system.

The output is placed in the 'build' directory.

* Mac

run make -f Makefile.mac

* Linux

run make -f Makefile.linux

* Windows

If anybody wants to volunteer a port (ha!), feel free.
