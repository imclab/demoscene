This is a very-quickly-hacked-together win port of the intro. iq pretty much did everything in few minutes at the party, but it doesn't work properly. Something is broken and it doesn't sound as it should, for example. Also it produced an error when exiting.

I have added it here for the sake of completeness. If you want to try and fix it, you're welcome :P
