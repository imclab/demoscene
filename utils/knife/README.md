The Knife is a command line utility to prepare demo captures for uploading to YouTube or similar services.

It can join together several videos (the sort of multiple video captures that DOSBox generates), and then add padding as required, etc, in order to generate a video with all the input videos.

Output can be WebM or MP4.

Just call the script with no arguments to get info about them.
